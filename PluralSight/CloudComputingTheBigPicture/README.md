# Categorizing Cloud Computing
- Cloud Applications: Commonly called Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Cloud Platforms: Technologies for running applications, storing data and more
- Private Clouds: Cloud platform technologies in on-premises datacenters

# Cloud Applications (SaaS)
- SaaS applications are generally multi-tenant
- Implementing SaaS: Multi-tenancy 
-- Single application is being shared by multiple customers
-- Each of these customers has own data
-- Responsibility of the application keep that data separate and secure
**Evaluating SaaS: Users**
Benefits
- Faster deployment: because no local installation is required
- Usage-based pricing: letting you pay only for what you use
- Less financial risk: with lower up-front cost and free trials
- Reduced need for on-premises resources: such as servers and IT staff
- Easier upgrades: with no on-premises software to update
Risks
- Requires trusting a SaaS provider: for availability and security
- Can raise legal/regulatory concerns: with storing data outside customer premises
- Can limit customization: if customers share a multi-tenant application
- Can be harder to integrate: with on-premises applications
- Can have lower performance than on-premises applications
**Evaluating SaaS: Software Vendors**
Benefits
- Can provide more predictable revenue stream than tradition licensing
- Can sell directly to business decision makers without going through IT
- Can lower support costs due to shared multi-tenant applications
- Provides more knowledge about how customers use the application
- Offers potential to reach new customers in broader markets
Risks
- Must demonstrate real value up front due to try-before-you-buy options
- Revenue comes in more slowly because of typical SaaS pricing models
- May lesson ability to sell customization services due to multi-tenant applications
- Can bring new sales challenges e.g customer resistence to the cloud
- Requires significant business changes e.g pricing and sales
**The impact of SaaS**
- For Users: Life is better as long as the risks aren't showstoppers
- For Software Vendors: Life is different everything changes: pricing, sales process, operations,...

# Cloud Platform
**What Cloud Platform Offer Over Traditional Hosting**
- Immediate access to more services
- Usage-Based pricing
- Global scale
**Evaluating Cloud Platforms**
Benefit
- Faster deployment because there's no wait for computing resources
- Usage-based pricing letting you pay only for what you use
- Less financial risk with lower up-front investment in hardware and software
- Reduced need for on-premises resources such as servers and IT staff
- Easier upgrades with no on-premises software to update
Risks
- Requires trusting a cloud platform provider for availability and data security
- Can raise legal/regulatory concerns with storing data outside customer premises
- Can be harder to integrate with on-premises software
- Can have lower performance than on-premises platforms
- Can give developers less control than on-premises platforms
**Cloud Platform Technologies**
- IaaS
- PaaS
- CaaS
- FaaS
- Object Storage
- Relational
- NoSQL
**Low-code Development Platform**
- A Flavor of PaaS: Provide services for creating logic, working with data, and more
- Often Aimed at Citizen Developers: People with some technical knowledge who aren't professional developers
- Widely Used Today: Salesforce Platform, Microsoft PowerApps, Mendix, OutSystems
**Cloud Platform Pricing**
- Usage-Based Pricing
- Commitment Brings Discounts
- Monthly Bills can be Substantial
**Multicloud**
Benefits
- Can choose the best services for you
- Can choose the lowest-cost services
- Not locked into a single cloud platform
Risks
- Can increase complexity
- Can compliance security
- Locked into multiple cloud platforms
Reality
- Different departments choose different platforms
- Multicloud can be hard to avoid

# Private Clouds
**Examining Private Cloud**
- The Tranditional Definition Public cloud services provided on premises
- What Private Cloud Is Not A new name for traditional on-premises datacenter
- A Confusing Market Vendors use the term in different ways
**What is a Hydrid Cloud?**
- Not just a hydrid application
- Public cloud services linked with private cloud
- Various services can be linked
**Some Approaches to Private Cloud**
- Public Cloud Tech on On-Prem Servers - Example: Azure Stack, AWS Outposts
- Cloud Technology for IoT Devices - Examples: AWS IoT Greengrass, Azure IoT Hub
- Edge Computing - A board category of solutions
-- What is means: Moving some computation into on-prem devices
-- When it matters: if interating with the cloud is too slow
-- Is it private Cloud? Probably Different vendors use this term differently
