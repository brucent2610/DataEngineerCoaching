- Data model: A collection of metadata that represents the logical organization, shape, and meaning of data

**Kinds of data (e.g master or transactional)**
- Master - Customer, hotel, sensor (don't change often)
- Transaction - Purchase, Check-in, Auto-orders
- Lookup - Description codes / IDs, FK relationships
- Meta data - Table data object description - Data type = "string"
**Logical vs physical**

- Entity Relationshop vs Foreign key relationship
- Row (entity) vs Row
- Model vs Schema
**Centricity**

**Data Model Cardinality**
- How the uniqueness of an entity defines its relationship to other entities based on data centricity, e.g one-to-many or many-to-many
